# flatpickr documentation source

This is the source for flatpickr's documentation and demos website. You

## Updating the documentation
This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Please refer to 
the installation instructions on Hugo's website to get it working on your 
system.

Each page has a corresponding markdown file inside the `content/` 
folder and that's where you need to add/remove information. JS, CSS and 
images are parsed from the `static/` folder.

After updating the files, run `hugo serve` to build and test the changes 
locally.
